      <p>
        <br>
        Here's a quick summary of what Lorin can do: <br><br>
          🌍 Suggest destinations (search for flights to anywhere) <br>
          🛫 Find actual flights! <br>
          🏨 Search for a hostel <br>
          🛌 Find you a hotel <br>
          📍 Give recommendations for things to do <br>
          🛂 Give you Visa information <br>
          🤖 Be human (say hello, thanks and bye - everyone has a better time that way!) <br>
          ... <br>
          😂 Tell jokes! <br>
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion tester">Are you a tester? 👉 Click here 👈</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <h1>Well, hello there! 👋</h1>
      <p>
        <br>
        First of all, you are super awesome for helping me test this! <b>You will be spared when robots take over 🤖</b><br><br>
          I'd love it if you could <b>have a play around with the chatbot</b> - either on Facebook or Skype <b>and then fill out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/an4EluFyZxJpLklA2">this questionnaire</a></b><br><br>
          If you have any questions, feel free to ask but hopefully, your interaction with the bot should feel as natural as possible! There's also a quick summary of the functionality above 👆👆<br><br>
          As for your data, do not worry - it will only be used for the purposes of this project, won't be released to third parties and your fantastic responses in the questionnaire will be anonymous so feel free to be as critical as you wish 😨<br><br>
          I encourage you to familiarise yourself with the privacy statement below as well as the terms of use and privacy statements of Facebook or Skype - depending on which one you use.<br><br>
          <b>Thank you, I owe you a beer for this 🍺</b><br>
